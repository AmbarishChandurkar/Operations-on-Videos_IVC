# Operations on Videos

1.1 Aim:
1. Task 1 : Extracting Frames from Videos
2. Task 2 : Playing Video in Reverse
3. Task 3 : Applying Background Subtraction, Frame Difference Algorithm

## Task 1

### Output : Task11.png (Figure 1: Every 6th Frame of the video, starting from 6th Frame)

### Comments:
1. The Video was imported successfully.
2. However, the successive frames have very small change.
3. Hence, for illustration purpose, frames have been plotted in multiples of 6.

## Task 2

### Output : Task12.png (Figure 2: Every 6th Frame of the video, starting from 6th Frame, showing the video playing in reverse)

### Comments:
1. The Video was imported successfully.
2. Similar to Task 1, the successive frames have very small change.
3. Hence, for illustration purpose, frames have been plotted in multiples of 6.
4. Observation reveals that the sequence is playing in reverse.

## Task 3

### Output : Task13.png (Figure 3: Every 6th Frame of the video, starting from 6th Frame, showing the Output of Frame Difference Algorithm)

### Comments:
1. Frame Difference Algorithm was applied successfully.
2. The images were converted to frames as shown in the code using 'im2frame'
function.
